In order of priority
1. Work on video/audio management (server issues are not controlable but try to fix everything else)
2. Make sure that leaving and rejoining meetings is handled correctly (last priority. can also be part of one above)

Creative Portion:
Added ability to toggle audio and video for user (adds privacy)
Also added ability for employee to reject a meeting since that can often happen where conflicts occur
Added ability to leave meetings prematurely and come back to them as that is a common feature in many apps
